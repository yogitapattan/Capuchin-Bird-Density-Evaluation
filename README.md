# Capuchin-Bird-Density-Evaluation


- Developed a deep learning model that accurately classifies Capuchin bird sounds in audio recordings.
- Trained the model using a large dataset of annotated bird sounds, leveraging techniques such as spectrogram analysis.
- Applied CNN model on the spectrogram representation of audio.
- Achieved impressive classification performance, with high recall and precision in identifying Capuchin bird sounds.
- Validated the model's performance through extensive testing and evaluation against independent audio recordings.
- Evaluated the density of Capuchin Birds from forest recording obtained from various parts of the forest.
- Explored various applications of the model, including monitoring Capuchin bird populations, assessing biodiversity, and supporting environmental impact assessments.

The Capuchin bird sound classification model has several potential applications in the field of ecology and conservation.

1. Monitoring Capuchin Bird Populations: By accurately identifying and counting Capuchin bird sounds in forest audio recordings, the model can help monitor the population dynamics of these birds. This information is crucial for assessing the conservation status of Capuchin birds and understanding their responses to habitat changes or other environmental factors.

2. Biodiversity Assessments: The presence and abundance of Capuchin birds serve as indicators of biodiversity within a forest ecosystem. By quantifying their sounds, the model contributes to assessing the overall biodiversity and ecological health of the forest. This information is valuable for conservation planning and prioritizing areas for protection.

3. Environmental Impact Assessments: When conducting environmental impact assessments for development projects near forested areas, the model can be used to assess potential impacts on Capuchin bird populations. By comparing sound recordings before and after the project, the model helps evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures and guides decision-making to minimize negative environmental impacts.
